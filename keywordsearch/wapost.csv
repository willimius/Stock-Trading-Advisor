Washington Post,Emma Brown,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/02/01/uc-berkeley-students-sue-google-alleging-their-emails-were-illegally-scanned/,"UC-Berkeley students sue Google, alleging their emails were illegally scanned","Four students and alumni from the University of California-Berkeley have sued Google in federal court, alleging that the company — which runs the university’s email accounts — illegally intercepted and scanned emails for advertising purposes without students’ knowledge or consent. Google’s Gmail service is a core feature of Google Apps for Education, which is provided for free to thousands of K-12 schools and universities and is used by more than 30 million students and teachers nationwide, according to the complaint. The lawsuit alleges that Google misled Berkeley and other institutions into believing that school email accounts would not be subject to scanning for commercial purposes. The schools, in turn, assured their students and staff of their privacy. But, the  alleges, Google was scanning and analyzing emails to serve targeted advertisements to students until April 30, 2014, when the company announced via a   that it had “permanently removed all ads scanning” in its email service for schools, “which means that Google cannot collect or use student data in Apps for Education services for advertising purposes.” That announcement amounted to a tacit acknowledgement that Google had been using information from student emails to target ads, according to the plaintiffs, who allege that Google violated the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. They are asking the court to force the company to delete any information derived from the scanned emails and pay damages. Under the law, the plaintiffs could collect up to $10,000 each, or $100 for each day that the law was broken, whichever is greater. “These schools and Plaintiffs reasonably did not know, understand, or suspect that Google was secretly reading their emails for commercial purposes,” says the complaint, filed Jan. 27 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, which has jurisdiction over many cases out of Silicon Valley. A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment. Khaliah Barnes of the Electronic Privacy Information Center said the lawsuit highlights how little the public knows about what information Google is collecting about students through its educational apps, and how that information is being used. “Google has not been subject to meaningful transparency, accountability and oversight concerning student records,” Barnes said. Chris Jay Hoofnagle, who teaches about privacy law and internet law at Berkeley, called Google’s alleged scanning “a radical attack on communications privacy.” And he’s concerned about far more than advertising. “Google could use information it gleans from the messages for its own purposes — purposes it does not have to disclose to us,” Hoofnagle said. “In effect, Google could act as an intelligence agency, deeply mining relationships and ideas among groups of people,” such as new inventions students and staff at Berkeley are developing. This is not the first time that Google — which has quickly grown into one of the nation’s largest providers of technology in schools — has been accused of misusing student data for commercial gain.     The scrutiny of Google is part of a broader debate over student privacy: Advocates say that K-12 and college students don’t have enough control over their own information, particularly as schools and universities turn to technology companies for everything from storing sensitive personal data to creating lessons tailored to individuals’ academic needs. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco-based privacy advocacy group, alleged in a   with the Federal Trade Commission that Google is gathering information about nearly everything that students are doing while signed into their school-based Google accounts. The complaint also alleged that the company is sometimes using that information to serve targeted advertisements, violating the   that it signed. FTC investigations are not public, and a spokesman for the agency said he could not confirm or deny whether it has opened a probe into those allegations. And a previous lawsuit, in 2013, alleged that Google was illegally scanning students’ emails, mirroring the Berkeley students’ claims.     But the earlier case — which was filed in the same federal court — was framed differently, as a class-action suit on behalf of virtually all users of Google’s Apps for Education. It ended in 2014, when a federal judge  , ruling that — because each school is responsible for its own privacy explanations and disclosures — users at some universities might have consented to the scanning of their emails. Ray Gallo, the lawyer for the plaintiffs in the current lawsuit, has taken a different approach: He aims to file many near-identical claims on behalf of plaintiffs from universities where students were clearly promised that their emails would not be scanned. He and his team used archived web pages to discern what individual schools were saying, between 2010 and 2014, about the privacy of the emails sent through university accounts. They found 11 schools that assured students in writing that their email accounts, though provided by Google, would not be scanned for advertising purposes. Berkeley, for example, told students that data from Google core services such as email “are not scanned for the purpose of displaying ads.” Other schools with similarly explicit promises included Harvard, Yale, UC-Santa Cruz and San Diego State University, the complaint says. The suit was first reported by San Diego State’s student newspaper, the  . Gallo said he is  additional potential plaintiffs from the 11 schools and — with the help of software that allows him to automate as much of the legal process as possible — anticipates filing “numerous” similar lawsuits in the future. “I joined the lawsuit to protect my privacy,” lead plaintiff Ryan Corley, a senior at Berkeley, said in a statement provided by Gallo. Like other students, Gallo said, Corley was required to use the account for school-related communications, and he used it to send personal information and educational records. He didn’t know of the alleged scanning of his emails until he saw an advertisement that Gallo’s firm placed, seeking potential plaintiffs for the case.",February 1,,google

But there was one noteworthy distinction of this particular art show   all of the pieces were created with the help of a Google computer program. The artwork relies on  that remakes an image to include whatever it is being told to see in the image. The end result is a hallucination of the image that has a psychedelic look. The new software provide artists an opportunity to be creative like never before. With this fresh approach to art, there are questions about who should get credit for the artwork. Should it be the artist, the computer software, or the software’s creator, and is the final product really art? For the London man behind one of the pieces that sold for $8,000, the price was an endorsement of artists’ continued value in a world that is increasingly reliant on technology and machines. (One other piece of art at the show also sold for $8,000.) While the creator Memo Akten said that Google has made a better “paintbrush,” the human artist is essential. Not just any image fed into the computer program can sell for so much, he said. began creating his artwork called “GCHQ” with a Google Maps screenshot of GCHQ, the British intelligence and security agency. He input it into a Google program called DeepDream, a   that anyone can use. But Akten went a step further, tweaking the code to produce multiple morphed versions of the Google Maps screenshot that were to his liking. One was covered in eyes, another had web-like detail and a third had a textured look. Then Akten merged those three images using Adobe AfterEffects into a single image, his final product. While the initial version of his art took only a couple hours to make, Akten later spent a couple weeks creating a larger scale version of the art. (The print that was sold was about six feet by three feet.) The inspiration behind the piece was Akten’s belief that tech companies such as Google and government agencies are like modern deities that play the role of religions in previous years. Patchen thinks credit for Atken’s work should be shared between the artist and the algorithm’s creators. Until the algorithm itself becomes a thinking being, he thinks it’s merely a tool, deserving of no credit. For Christiane Paul, the adjunct curator of new media arts at the Whitney Museum of American Art, credit solely lies with the artist. She noted that an artist using Adobe Photoshop to make a piece of art wouldn’t credit the team that had made Photoshop. Paul said artists have long sought new tools to elevate their work, such as creating a new color or finding a new material to work with. “Whether it’s a new paintbrush or pigment or neural network, they are all potentially great tools for creating sophisticated art,” said Paul, who felt Akten’s work was rich in creativity.",March 10,,google

Google’s 53 vehicles have driven more than 1.4 million miles autonomously and been in 17 crashes, but never been at fault before. The crash took place at 3:20 p.m. Feb. 14, about three miles from Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. Google’s car was attempting to make a right-hand turn on red, and moved to the right side of a wide lane on El Camino Real to pass traffic stopped at the light. But as Google’s car neared the intersection of Castro Street, its path was blocked by sandbags around a storm drain, according to a report Google filed with the California DMV. Google’s car tried to go around the sandbags by cutting into the line of vehicles on the left side of the lane. Instead, it struck a metal piece connecting the two halves of an accordion-style bus, according to a Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority spokeswoman.

Both parties said there were no injuries and described the crash as minor. “We hope to handle situations like this more gracefully in the future,” Google said in a monthly report. “We clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn’t moved there wouldn’t have been a collision.” The accident highlights the imperfections of the current self-driving technology, which is widely seen as a promising solution to the thousands of lives lost each year on roadways.

Using one of the Internet's favorite mascots, minions from ""Despicable Me,"" Google replaced its normal ""Send and Archive"" button with a bright-orange one that guaranteed you'd have the last word by blocking any replies that may come after that message. It also appended a sassy little GIF of a minion dropping a mic. Cute, right? But panic — not hilarity — ensued after the prank was deployed. Google's product forums were soon full of reports from users saying that the feature had seriously hurt them personally and professionally when they hit the button by accident for emails that they really shouldn't have. The complaints prompted Google to take back its joke and apologize for the inconvenience. Oh, dear. For those affected by the prank, there is, however  a way to recover your messages. You can find the replies to your email in the ""All Mail"" folder, a Google spokesman said. Users on Google's help forums have also reported that you can find any replies by finding the email thread in your ""Sent"" folder, and then moving it to your Inbox. While it won't undo whatever damage may already be done, you will at least be able to see how people responded. Then, you can send a fresh email explaining the circumstances.     It'd be easy to say that those complaining just can't take a joke. Yet that glosses over the fact that email is a channel for some pretty serious communication. ""I send a legal document which affects mine and my family's life and you stick that button in the place of a send button,"" reads a post from one of many complainants pointing out that maybe the feature wasn't such a good idea. Others said on the forum that they may have lost job opportunities because of the feature, after accidentally using it in emails to prospective employers or to freelance editors. Technologist Andy Baio, after criticizing Google for their ""short-sighted"" prank, posted   of people who'd run afoul of the prank, including one woman who accidentally attached the GIF to a request for prayers. Google, to its credit, wholeheartedly acknowledged that it messed up. In a statement, the company said, ""Well, it looks like we pranked ourselves this year. Due to a bug, the MicDrop feature inadvertently caused more headaches than laughs. We’re truly sorry. The feature has been turned off. If you are still seeing it, please reload your Gmail page."" The company did not disclose what, if anything, it paid to license the Minion characters for the joke feature. The Google spokesman said that the company isn't sure how many people may have used the feature between when it first went live at 1 a.m. Friday Zurich time (7 p.m. Eastern on Thursday) and when it was removed   The feature was not turned on for professional ""Google Apps"" accounts — which may have limited some of the potential professional damage —  but it's clear that a lot of people use the consumer version of Gmail for serious business as well. Things appear to be back to normal for most Gmail users; in fact, many users may have never seen the button at all. But some users have reported that they've had trouble getting the feature to stop with conversations on which they've already used ""Mic Drop,""  . For example, some users have reported using the joke feature on a draft email with no recipients, only to find themselves still unable to get replies after using the normal send button.     Is this a lesson in being careful about what you click? Yes. But it should also be a lesson for companies to think carefully about how people actually use their products — and a cautionary tale in how not to mess that up.",April 1,,google

Under a deadline for opening bids  , companies as diverse as Google, Verizon and Time Inc.  -- and a raft of Wall Street buyout firms -- may soon find themselves in a dogfight to own one of the biggest digital media properties on the planet, despite its gloomy outlook. Yahoo's financial situation is worse than most analysts even knew. The company is projecting steep drops in revenue and earnings for 2016 — more than 15 percent, according to a book of internal figures obtained by  . The documents come just weeks after Yahoo   it was laying off more than 1,500 employees and a quarterly loss of $4.4 billion. The book containing the detailed numbers is being shown to Yahoo's potential buyers, and it appears to suggest that a return to growth is not anywhere on the horizon. In light of such troubles, why would anybody want to buy Yahoo? The answer comes down to eyeballs and advertising. Despite its declining fortunes, Yahoo is still the third-largest digital media company in the United States, attracting a whopping 202.5 million unique visitors in November, according to the analytics firm comScore. That beats out Wikipedia, ESPN and the Weather Channel. Only Google and Facebook commanded larger audiences. At that scale, Yahoo is an Internet giant. It draws 84% of its revenue from ads that appear on its main search page on desktop computers, known as search and display advertising. And that makes it a tasty morsel for companies who are either just entering the online advertising space or who believe they can improve upon Yahoo's formula. Yahoo's inability to establish a profitable advertising business off its trove of consumer data has put it at a severe disadvantage to Google and Facebook, analysts say. Instead of selling high-value ads aimed at very specific audiences, Yahoo offers advertisers ""broader, less targeted"" ads, said Forrester analyst Jim Nail. As a result, advertisers spend all their money on Google and Facebook and “throw a few crumbs” to Yahoo as an afterthought, Nail said. The declines in Yahoo’s business reflect falling revenues from search ads, as users and ad dollars migrate to mobile devices and to technologies that can track user behavior across platforms. While Facebook and Google have been adept at managing this transition, Yahoo hasn’t been able to offset declines in its desktop search business with gains in mobile. “They are just not able to pull all their data together in a way that is attractive to advertisers,” Nail said of Yahoo's executives. He added: ""All these players think they’d do a better job monetizing its audience than Yahoo has done."" One of the leading ""players"" to land Yahoo is Verizon, analysts said. Verizon may have begun as a phone company. But it is rapidly becoming an Internet business in its own right, buying AOL last year for $4 billion and   to improve how it places ads on online video and other digital content. (By the way, AOL counted 174 million unique visitors in November.) The interest from Verizon comes as the telecom industry realizes it is no longer profitable to act as a mere supplier of mobile data and Internet access. Now, companies are moving to offer their own content and services over their own networks, as well as looking to gather data on their subscribers that can be applied toward advertising. ""This is about Verizon building a stronger business focus around data-gathering and applications that enables them to expand their advertising resources,"" said Gene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department antitrust official who now leads the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. Robert Peck, managing director at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, said the deal is ""Verizon's to lose."" Peck added that combining Yahoo and AOL would give Verizon a scale that would enable it to compete with Google and Facebook in the race to capture ad dollars. And it would significantly enhance the company's data mining and tracking capabilities. Verizon could also layer its mobile data with Yahoo's. ""Data is the gold of the Internet. The more data you have the better your target ability,"" said Peck. Peck estimates that Yahoo's Web businesses are worth between $6 billion to $8 billion. Bloomberg reported Thursday that Verizon has hired three financial advisers to work on its bid. Verizon and Yahoo declined to comment. Time Inc., another rumored buyer, could incorporate Yahoo's audience into its own, scaling an already massive publishing operation. With 110 million monthly unique visitors, Time is the 15th-largest site on the U.S. Internet, according to comScore. But with Yahoo, Time could easily muscle its way into the top 10, if not higher. And that could ultimately mean more advertising dollars. A spokesperson for Time declined to comment. The same could be true of Google, which Bloomberg said is mulling a bid. Imagine if Google took its substantial ad prowess and applied it to Yahoo's content and audience, eliminating a lesser rival in the process. But for those precise reasons, Google would likely face stiff scrutiny from antitrust regulators who have eyed the company suspiciously in the past, said Kimmelman. ""That's a huge antitrust issue,"" he said. ""There would be an enormous red flag."" Google declined to comment. We've been here before. In 2008, Google and Yahoo were forced to abandon an advertising partnership under threat of litigation from the Justice Department,   that the deal would have turned two of the biggest competitors on the Internet into collaborators that could together choke off competition in search advertising. But search advertising is just one form of the art. Increasingly, ads can be sold against a proliferating number of platforms. And smart media companies are realizing that the only way to survive is to sell ads on all of them. This is resulting in a potential advertising scrum that pits companies of seemingly unrelated industries against one another. Suddenly, Verizon's business model starts to look very much like Google's, which in turn is not too dissimilar from Time's. So the biggest antitrust questions of the future will be raised not by the prospect of one search engine knocking out another, as Google could do to Yahoo, but rather over advertising across the whole Internet. And regulators will be in the middle, trying to define where one type of advertising market ends and another begins.",April 7,,google

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday overturned a district judge who had sided with Google. U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate ruled last year that the unit of Alphabet Inc. didn’t have to answer a subpoena by Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood. Hood began complaining in 2012 that Google wasn’t doing enough to prevent people from breaking the law. In October 2014, he sent a 79-page subpoena demanding Google produce information about a wide range of subjects, including whether Google helps criminals by allowing its search engine to lead to pirated music, having its autocomplete function suggest illegal activities and sharing YouTube ad revenue with the makers of videos promoting illegal drug sales. Instead of complying, Google sued. The appeals court also dissolved the lower judge’s injunction that had barred Hood from bringing any civil or criminal lawsuits against the Mountain View, California-based company, saying that a mere subpoena wasn’t enough to rule that Hood was acting in bad faith.  “This injunction covers a fuzzily defined range of enforcement actions that do not appear imminent,” Chief Circuit Judge Carl E. Stewart wrote for a three-judge panel. “We cannot on the present record predict what conduct Hood might one day try to prosecute under Mississippi law.” The judges also noted that Hood would have to go to state court to force Google to comply with the administrative subpoena and that Google could challenge Hood’s requests then. The appeals panel ordered Wingate to dismiss Google’s entire lawsuit. Google had contended that Hood should be blocked, saying Google and similar companies can’t be sued under the federal Communications Decency Act for what others post on the Internet. The panel said Google might be able to file a federal lawsuit later. Google also claimed Hood’s investigation was tainted by a close association with the movie industry. Wingate had ruled Hood’s subpoena was retaliation for Google not knuckling under to his demands. The judges said they weren’t ruling whether Hood’s subpoena is reasonable or whether Google was immune federal law. Hood spokeswoman Rachael Ring said the attorney general plans to discuss the ruling at a Monday news conference. A number of other attorneys general had asked the appeals court to dissolve the injunction, saying it was a blow to the investigative power of all states. It’s unclear whether Google will appeal.  “We’re reviewing the implications of the court’s decision, which focused on whether our claim was premature rather than on the merits of the case,” spokesman William Fitzgerald wrote in an email Saturday. Google has argued Hood wants to censor the Internet and violate Google’s constitutional rights. Leaked documents indicated that the Motion Picture Association of America helped draft the subpoena. The movie industry and Google have been at odds over copyright law, with studios failing to win more restrictive federal laws. Hood has defended his cooperation with the movie industry, saying he’s working with victims of crimes. ___ Online: U.S. 5th Circuit ruling: http://1.usa.gov/20qx02e ___ Follow Jeff Amy at: http://twitter.com/jeffamy.

Critics have “pointed out that any attempt to ban strong encryption in American products would only force people seeking law-enforcement-proof data protection to use encryption software created outside the U.S., of which there is plenty to choose from.”  The Justice Department says it’s going to continue to fight to force Apple to crack an iPhone related to a New York drug investigation. “Just two weeks ago, the government dropped its effort to require Apple to crack an iPhone used by one of the shooters in the December attacks in San Bernardino, California, saying it had unlocked the phone without Apple’s help,” Reuters  . “Some observers thought the government would back away from the New York case too, since the suspect has already pleaded guilty.

In 2016, Turing’s ghost has come to haunt Silicon Valley in a big way. Companies are racing to build technology that can talk with you. Last month, Microsoft launched the Microsoft Bot Framework, a set of software tools that let companies create their own conversational bots. Customers of Domino's, for instance, can order products by chatting back and forth with a robot, as if they were sending a text message. Dozens of startups are also building chat bots that do things like schedule a meeting, conduct a basic Q&A with a job candidate, or collect daily pain reports from a patient. (None of these pass the Turing Test yet). On Tuesday, Facebook dropped its own mic in this increasingly noisy room. At its annual developer conference in San Francisco, the social network announced it would enable third-parties to build chat bots into its highly popular Messenger service. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg demonstrated a CNN bot that could send personalized news stories as well as another one from 1-800-FLOWERS that could carry on a conversation with a customer who wanted to order flowers. ""You never have to call 1-800-FLOWERS again,"" Zuckerberg said. Facebook's embrace of a bot platform is likely to set off an arms race, as major tech companies try to define how bots will be built and how they will interact with ordinary consumers. The tech giants know that whoever controls the most popular platforms for bots has the ability to dictate to -- and profit from -- an entire generation of retailers, taxi services, movie ticket firms and others that build for that technology.     The chatbot explosion bears a resemblance to the fledgling app economy, circa 2009. Apple had launched its app store the previous year -- Google’s Play Store didn’t come until 2012 -- and “ ” became a refrain in the media. Today, apps are a $50 billion economy,  , which tracks app sales. As apps proliferated, Apple and Google forged ahead with app store marketplaces that served as platforms for hundreds of thousands of other companies to sell their services. Apple’s app store revenues exceeded $20 billion last year, the company said. Google doesn’t break out Google Play revenues, but estimates put the number above $7 billion. Amazon and Microsoft haven’t made significant inroads in the app world -- and perhaps this is why they seem so eager to usher in a way to find goods and services through bots. Consumers may also be ready for a new platform. Besides messaging apps, such as WhatsApp, WeChat and  Facebook Messenger, enthusiasm for new apps appears to be waning. According to a Forrester report last year, consumers spent 80 percent of their time on   --  80 percent of those are owned by Google and Facebook - even though they’ve downloaded an average of 24 apps.     “The same set of drivers that propelled apps to be really new exist with bots,” said Phil Libin, managing director of venture capital firm Catalyst Partners. “The next version of that is going to be bots.” The bot battle lines will look very different from those in the app wars. While it’s relatively easy to build an app, getting computers to actually understand language and hold real conversations is much harder, said Forrester analyst Jeffrey Hammond. The adoption curve could be slower as a result. Just ask meeting scheduler app x.ai. Behind the scenes, human developers are labeling every bit of language that the company’s dozens of beta users use to discuss something as simple as getting together for a coffee. Despite advances in AI, labeling by hand is still necessary, said x.ai chief executive Dennis Mortensen. For instance, if a human suggests meeting sometime “Wed-Fri,” a computer wouldn't automatically understand that the suggestion includes Thursday.     “These aren’t wide open queries,” Forrester analyst Julie Ask said of the types of questions that users can ask bots. “I’d be surprised if this was game-changing on day one.” Even the developers of these artificial intelligence technologies acknowledge that mistakes -- potentially big ones that could deflate consumer interest -- will be associated with this technology for quite some time. In its apology for unintended racist comments made by Tay -- a Twitter-based chat bot recently launched, and then shuttered, by Microsoft -- the company said such mistakes may be necessary for artificial intelligence to improve. “We cannot fully predict all possible human interactive misuses without learning from mistakes,” the company said. (Flickr engineers had a similar response when its photo-recognition technology mischaracterized an image of a concentration camp as a “jungle gym.”) Moreover, the emerging market for bot platforms is fragmented among a different set of players than before. While Google and Apple took the lead during the app wars, one of the first companies to launch a bot store was Kik, the Canadian messaging app that has a $50 million investment from Chinese Internet giant Tencent. The store lets users interact with and request information via chat from companies such as The Weather Channel, Funny or Die, or Vine. Then there’s the popular office productivity software Slack, which has also encouraged startups to build chat bots onto its platform to do things like order lunch. Even   in on the action. Tellingly, the U.S. web giants forging ahead with bot platforms – Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon (which has allowed developers to build services on its virtual assistant, Alexa) -- do not dominate the app universe. This makes sense. Apple and Google have a lot to lose if an ecosystem of bots could replace the functionality of today’s apps. Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon would have much to gain. “Everyone who didn’t win the app platform wars will get another chance with bots,” said Libin.",April 12,,google
Washington Post,Philip Bump,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/14/the-democratic-debate-in-brooklyn-drove-a-lot-of-people-in-vermont-to-google/,The Democratic debate in Brooklyn drove a lot of people (in Vermont) to Google,"Vermont loves Bernie Sanders. Loves him. Looooves him. Vermont loves Bernie Sanders so much that during a presidential debate in Brooklyn, N.Y., a few days before the New York primary and weeks after Sanders already won the primary in Vermont, the state that was conducting the most searches for Hillary Clinton and Sanders on Google was the great state of Vermont. The top metro areas in the New York region? Burlington, Vt.-Plattsburgh, N.Y. The person who drove the most Google searches? Bernie Sanders -- in New York, Vermont and everywhere else. Unlike most previous debates, there were noticeable spikes in search interest during the commercials. People watched, then went to search once the debating stopped. The biggest spike was in searches for Sanders after the thing ended. The biggest spikes   the debate were when Clinton and Sanders were talking about tax returns and Sanders was talking about his not-very-cordial relationship with big business. (There weren't many searches for Clinton's speech transcripts. There were for her taxes, which she told people to go check out.) The top   moment came shortly after, when the two were discussing the minimum wage (it's the other big Clinton spike on the graph above). Our idea with this whole ""what are people Googling"" experiment was that people would see something in the debate and then go to Google to learn more. We hoped to learn what things were resonating with voters (or, at least, with the people watching). The answer in this case appears to be that Vermonters were tuning in to watch what may be the last debate in which Sanders participates. And then, for some reason, they Googled to find out how tall he is. As people always do.",April 14,,google
Washington Post,Emma Brown,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2016/02/16/google-says-it-tracks-personal-student-data-but-not-for-advertising/,"Google says it tracks personal student data, but not for advertising","What does Google do with the personal information it collects from children who use Google products at school? That has become a pressing question for privacy advocates as Google has quickly grown into one of the nation’s largest providers of educational technology in K-12 schools. Now Google has provided some answers to that question in a seven-page letter to Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), the ranking member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law. Google does not use K-12 students’ personal information to serve targeted advertisements, the company says in the letter, which was signed by Sue Molinari, Google’s vice president for public policy and government relations. But Google does track data from students for other reasons, including developing and improving Google products, the company wrote. Such tracking happens when students are signed into their Google Apps for Education account but are using certain Google services — such as Search, YouTube, Blogger and Maps — that are considered outside Google’s core educational offerings. Thousands of K-12 schools and universities — and more than 30 million students and teachers — use Google’s Apps for Education, which the company provides to schools free of charge. Franken said that Google’s response was “thorough,” but said he will seek further clarification from Google about some of its privacy policies regarding student data. “Google’s response to my questioning was thorough, and I appreciate its engagement on this topic,” Franken said in a statement. “But I’m still concerned about what exactly Google does with the information it collects and processes from students who are browsing outside websites—like YouTube—while logged in to Google’s education services. I’m also still interested in whether or not Google can provide parents and students with stronger privacy protections—for example, by allowing students to ‘opt-in’ to data collection. I plan to continue working with Google to clarify some of its policies, because it’s important for the privacy of our students.” The company also said that it does not sell student data to third parties and does not share students’ personal information except in a few circumstances outlined in its public privacy policies — such as when schools ask the company to share the data, or the law requires it. The letter came in response to a request from Franken last month that Google provide detailed information about its student privacy policies, voicing concern that children’s personal information was being collected and used without parents’ knowledge or consent. “I believe Americans have a fundamental right to privacy, and that right includes a student or parent’s access to information about what data are being collected about them and how the data are being used,” Franken wrote in his  to Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Franken asked Google to explain not only whether it is targeting ads to students now, but whether it has ever done so. The company answered that question obliquely, writing that while ads in its educational services have “always been off by default,” in 2014 the company took the “ ” of removing administrators’ ability to turn on ads. The “additional step” refers to a blog post that Google published in April 2014 after facing a lawsuit alleging that Google had illegally scanned student emails for commercial gain. The blog post said that the company had “permanently removed all ads scanning” in its email service for schools. Privacy advocates saw it as a tacit admission that the company had indeed been scanning student emails in order to target ads. The lawsuit, which was framed as a class-action case on behalf of virtually all users of Google’s education apps, ended in 2014 after a federal judge declined to certify the class. The company is now facing similar allegations in a case filed last month by four students and alumni from the University of California-Berkeley.     Nate Cardozo, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco-based privacy group, said that the letter is the first time that Google has made an unqualified statement that it does not target ads to K-12 students. That could mean that the company did target ads until recently, but its practices have now changed, Cardozo said. The Electronic Frontier Foundation alleged in a December 2015 filing with the Federal Trade Commission that Google is gathering information about nearly everything that students are doing while signed into their school-based Google accounts. Cardozo said he believes that Google’s tracking of data when students use Maps, Search and other such applications amounts to collection of student data without parental knowledge or consent, which he said he believes is a violation of the voluntary Student Privacy Pledge that Google signed. In its letter to Franken, Google says that administrators have the authority to decide which apps students may use, and can only allow access if parents consent.

Washington Post,Brian Fung,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/03/14/i-rode-in-googles-self-driving-car-this-is-what-impressed-me-the-most/,I rode in Google’s self-driving car. This is what impressed me the most.,"Google's self-driving car knows how to run yellow lights. But unlike regular humans, it doesn't have to guess whether it'll beat the countdown. Instead, it turns what for many of us is a split-second decision based on experience and guts into a heavily calculated dance of probability, speed and trajectory. Roughly 230 feet before it hits an intersection, it scans the light with its cameras and, based on the thousands of other data points it's tracking in its surroundings, the car will make the right call. I saw some of this stuff first-hand Sunday during SXSW, when I met a team from Google — sorry,   — for a private demo in north Austin. Here's what it's really like to use the technology that's poised to reshape how we commute, run our businesses and even design our cities. The first thing you notice when you get into one of Google's modified hybrid Lexuses is a long, black bar sitting on the dashboard. This displays the time — in the iconic   you see on Android smartphones — as well as a graphical representation of the car and its surroundings. This isn't your average GPS navigation screen, though. This one rendered buildings and obstacles as tiny, shimmering white dots, as if they were cobwebs that had clumped together to form little rectangles and squares. And they constantly refreshed based on what the car's sensors saw. As we began moving, new readings added new dots to the screen, while others faded away. The overall impression was one of a constantly undulating ocean of data — which, of course, it was. We paused at the edge of the parking lot before the Googler behind the wheel, Gavino Nastor, warned me he was about to turn on the autonomous mode. ""You'll just have to trust that my feet are off the pedals, okay?"" said Nastor. The whimsicality of his corporate title — Road Warrior — seemed to belie a deadly seriousness about what Google was trying to do to the car industry. I was told I couldn't take any pictures or video from the inside, so I'll have to make do with written descriptions. To the left of the steering column, there's a button to enable the car's autonomous drive, and a button that Google calls its "" "" — a vertical bar that lets the driver manually accelerate the car to match the speed of traffic while autonomous mode is turned on. Push up to go faster; push down to go slower. On the steering wheel, there's an  . Nastor pressed the ""on"" button, and away we went. As we glided into a left turn and onto West Anderson Lane, a bustling four-lane thoroughfare, one thing became immediately clear: The car brilliantly grasps the basic mechanics of driving, but it hasn't yet mastered the   of it. It's got a bit of a lead foot, so your head gets thrown back a bit as it accelerates like a teenager with a new license. Same with the braking: Where experienced drivers know to lift their foot off the pedal slightly at the end to avoid giving themselves whiplash, Google's car brakes rather aggressively. Google expects these quirks to be ironed out in the long run. Part of the reason why the car accelerates so quickly is because it tends to wait a second after a light turns green to allow any red-light runners or crossing pedestrians to clear out. Safety first, human-like later, Nastor said. You may notice that the car I rode in isn't the pod-like prototype car that Google has also been working on. (Nastor said other testers have likened the prototype to toasters, koala bears and marshmallows.) But although Google's long-term vision is to make the steering wheel obsolete — it's safer to do so, company officials have argued, because humans are fallible — realistically there may need to be some intermediate step that eases people into that future. And if so, then the modified Lexus would represent a reasonable first stab at it. Other than that slight choppiness, the rest of the ride went remarkably smoothly. We tooled around small residential streets — which represent some of the toughest conditions for Google's computer because of all the random events that can occur in those zones — and the Lexus glided around parked cars, yielded for pedestrians and even did the equivalent of nodding to oncoming cyclists. They couldn't see that, of course, but a laptop hooked up to the car showed that it acknowledged two green squares on the other side of the street. The colors that you sometimes see in those Google screencaptures really mean something. Pink indicates objects that are being detected by the car's lasers; blue means objects that are being picked up by radar; and green means that the lasers and the radar readings match, or ""cross-validate."" Even without lane markers in the residential area, the Google car was able to stay centered thanks to all the other readings it was gathering from the environment. And none of the data it was using had been drawn from Google Maps or Google Street View. Google Maps isn't helpful because the car has to physically drive the preplanned route a couple of times before it's ready to perform the task on its own. And Street View images don't provide enough depth — they offer only a 2-D image whereas the car needs a constant 3-D picture. Jennifer Haroon, head of business for Google's self-driving cars, explained Sunday that there's another reason the cars don't talk to Google Maps or the rest of the Internet. ""That was a security decision,"" Haroon said. The less insulated a car's driving systems are, the more exposed it is to potential hackers. And with these cars making life-or-death calls on behalf of human beings, that's a dangerous thing. As we pulled back out onto the main road, the engineers explained that Google's car comes with two routing programs — a ""long-term router"" that acts much like the GPS device on a normal car, and another, short-term router that makes decisions on when to speed up, slow down, turn and execute other maneuvers. Most of the magic in a driverless car happens in the short-term router, calculating predictions 10 times per second. If the short-term router determines that there's an accident ahead or it's more efficient to take a different route, the long-term router adapts. ""It's always going to follow the short-term router's decisions,"" the engineers said. Our ride took a little less than 15 minutes. But even in that span of time, I realized I'd spent more of my attention asking questions than worrying whether the car was going to roll out into an intersection without looking. My eyes had mostly been glued to the laptop displaying technical data about the car, because what I was feeling in my seat, and seeing out the window, seemed completely normal. Within minutes, I was already trusting the car — partly, of course, thanks to the fact that I had Google engineers with me who seemed pretty relaxed themselves. The average consumer won't have the benefit of someone holding his or her hand when driverless cars reach the market. But the best technology leaves you wanting more — and that's exactly what this did.",March 14,,google
Washington Post,Michael Cavna,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2016/03/21/d-c-student-wins-national-google-doodle-contest-with-art-that-invokes-black-lives-matter/,Today’s winning Google Doodle invoking Black Lives Matter was designed by a high school sophomore," month, Akilah Johnson was “surprised and overwhelmed” when she learned that she was a national finalist in the   for elementary through high school students. Imagine how she feels now. Akilah, a sophomore at Eastern Senior High School in Northeast Washington, has just been named Google’s big winner in the national contest, topping the 53 state and territory champions, whose work had been culled from about 100,000 student entries. “It is   overwhelming,” Akilah tells The Post’s Comic Riffs, minutes after receiving the news Monday during a ceremony at Google headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. “I was so excited, I started crying,” Akilah says. “I didn’t even look at anybody — I was just looking at the framed copy [of the Doodle] they gave me.” Akilah is the contest’s first winner from Washington, as D.C. was not eligible to enter the states-only competition in past years. (The Post’s Comic Riffs had joined the chorus of voices urging that the District be included.) This year’s contest theme was: “What makes me…  Akilah drew a box-braided Doodle, titled “My Afrocentric Life,” using color pencils, black crayons and Sharpie markers. The Doodle includes symbols of black heritage and signs representing the Black Lives Matter movement. “Although it felt like forever making this picture, it only took me about two weeks,” Akilah told Comic Riffs last month. “I based this picture off my lifestyle,” she stated as part of her entry, which is featured today on Google’s home page. “As a child, I attended Roots [Public Charter School] and Roots [Activity Learning Center], so I was raised in the ‘Afrocentric lifestyle,’ ” Akilah told The Post, referring to educational institutions in Northwest Washington that tout “culturally relevant curriculum” and the aim to serve “the specific needs of children of African heritage.” “One of my teachers from Roots, Baba Camera, is really [who] made me look at art in a different way,” Akilah said. “As I grew older, I … realized that the black people [who] came before us … made us into what we are today, so of course I had to include them in some way.” (“Of all the things I chose to include,” Akilah writes on  , “the six most special to me are the Symbol of Life [the ankh], the African continent, where everything began for me and my ancestors, the Eye of Horus, the word ‘power’ drawn in black, the woman’s fist based on one of my favorite artist’s works, and the D.C. flag — because I’m a Washingtonian at heart and I love my city with everything in me!”)     Another art teacher crucial to Akilah’s creative journey thus far is Zalika Perkins, who personally urged Akilah to enter Google’s contest. “She just went with it,” Perkins tells The Post of Akilah’s response. “I thought she would do a great job. She made deadline … and created a beautifully layered piece.” Perkins’s only concern: “I thought it was so culturally rich that I didn’t know if people would appreciate it.” Akilah’s composition reflects bright childhood themes on the left, then moves into more serious reflections on society. “Just as we read from left to right, my goal was to make the picture turn heads from the color to the meaning,” Akilah told Comic Riffs last month. “I have a book that I use that’s full [of] quotes, and the one I went by for this picture was: ‘Be the type of person [who] not only turns heads, but turns souls.’ ” And today, all eyes were turned toward Akilah, who brought her mother, Tikecia Johnson, and Perkins along on the trip to California. “I never imagined we would be here,” Perkins says today, “but she totally earned it.” Besides seeing her work spotlighted on Google’s home page, Akilah will receive a $30,000 college scholarship, and her high school will be awarded a $50,000 Google for Education grant “towards the establishment and improvement of a computer lab or technology program.” She also will get to meet with professional artists at Google’s headquarters. “I’m excited about the scholarship,” Akilah says, “and I’m excited about [being on] Google’s home page even more.” And what does she hope millions of Google users will take away from viewing her Doodle? “I hope they feel inspired,” Akilah says, “and try to understand the picture as I want them to understand it.” The contest’s celebrity judges included athletes Steph Curry and Alex Morgan; astronaut Yvonne Cagle; performers Julie Bowen and B.J. Novak; and animator Glen Keane (“Tangled”). Eastern High celebrated Akilah with an assembly last month, when she was announced as a finalist. “I’m very goofy, so I just started going around smiling and telling everyone, even the people I didn’t know,” Akilah said in February. “Before the assembly started, I was pretty nervous, but after a while, I warmed up and it felt great to have all of my peers support me.” Just imagine all the support she’ll feel now.      ",March 21,,google
Washington Post,Hayley Tsukayama,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/03/24/why-google-would-care-about-making-a-keyboard-for-the-iphone/,Why Google would care about making a keyboard for the iPhone,"Google is building a software keyboard for use on the iPhone and other iOS devices,   -- though it's not yet clear if it will be released to consumers. Why would the company be interested in making a keyboard for its archrival? Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It’s not as weird as it may sound. Google does, of course, make plenty of apps for the iPhone already, for everything from maps to its many Google Drive applications, that feed directly into popular services that millions already use. According to Newton, this keyboard would serve a similar purpose by incorporating Google’s search engine directly into the keyboard. That would be convenient for the vast majority of people who prefer to use Google for searches. It would also give the company yet another point of contact with consumers. Google has an undeniable lead in the search game, but that business is changing significantly as people have started using their phones to search, rather than their computers. Google feels the effects of that in a couple ways. For one, mobile ads don’t cost as much as desktop ads and therefore deliver lower returns for Google. While the firm isn’t exactly in trouble, having pulled in   in revenue that its parent company Alphabet reported last month, this shift is still a point of concern for Google. The other issue is that app use has increased, decreasing the mobile searches overall. As Newton reported, as people turn more to apps, they’re using search engines less often. It’s pretty normal behavior for someone to search for “Twitter” or “Facebook” rather than navigating directly to the site on a desktop. But if someone’s on their phone, it’s likely that they’ll just tap on the dedicated app rather than going to the mobile Web version of those sites. The same is true for review websites such as Yelp or travel sites such as Expedia. Building search directly into the keyboard, however, could help Google boost mobile searches just by making a search super-convenient. Newton reported that Google’s also looking at incorporating other features such as GIF and image searches, which would add even more value to the program. Apple started allowing third-party keyboards on the iPhone from iOS 8, opening its user base to a number of smaller companies that make keyboards with features that Apple doesn't offer in its stock keyboard. Adding a new keyboard does require users to do a little bit of fiddling with their settings, but many companies such as Swype have    in users since Apple changed its policies.",March 24,,google

Now, the company that brought gigabit speeds to Austin and Kansas City is moving deeper into the telecom industry by offering its own bundled telephone service. For $10 a month, Google Fiber customers soon will be able to buy an add-on known as   — a service that, according to a company blog post, appears to mimic much of the functionality of Google Voice. Voicemail on Fiber Phone can be automatically transcribed and sent to your email. You'll get unlimited domestic calling, as well as international calls at Google Voice's rates. And you'll have access to one phone number that can be set up to ring all of your phones — whether landline or mobile. A series of   first uncovered Google Fiber's plans to move into phone service. But now the decision is official: Fiber Phone will roll out gradually across all of the company's existing markets. The company declined to name the initial launch markets, saying those details will come later. The service comes with a little black box that sits beside your home phone. It has both ethernet and phone jacks, and will work with most handsets except for old rotary phones, according to Kelly Mason, a company spokesperson. Google Fiber's effort to draw in phone customers highlights how the company is becoming more like traditional service providers even as many telecom companies are looking to become more like Internet content firms. Even providers of cellphone service have been shifting their focus away from voice and toward the more lucrative provision of mobile data. Reports this week   T-Mobile may soon unveil new phone plan options that eliminate voice service entirely to give you a bigger bucket of data. Fiber Phone fits within these trends in that it would help customers add some cloud-based functionality to their home phones. But it's not immediately clear why consumers would pick Fiber Phone over Google Voice. The two services share many of the same features, but Fiber Phone carries a subscription cost and requires an at-home installation that you don't need with Google Voice. In this respect, Google Voice might be considered a ""better"" service. Fiber Phone could be appealing to those who currently buy their Internet and television from Google Fiber, but still have their landline phone tied to another provider, such as Verizon. Signing up for Fiber Phone would allow those Americans to eliminate one more bill from their lives and consolidate their services into a double- or triple-play deal with Google Fiber. But   show Americans are largely moving away from landline service anyway, embracing a cellphone-only approach. Forty percent of U.S. adults now use their cellphones exclusively. Fiber Phone is more than a simple landline substitute, of course. But to really make the most of it, it seems like you would A) need to be already subscribed to a landline service with another provider and B) want to continue having landline service.",March 29,,google
Washington Post,Karen Turner,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/03/31/using-google-maps-may-reduce-the-amount-of-grey-matter-in-your-brain/,An accidental invasion of Costa Rica and other errors made by relying on Google Maps,"A Google Maps error has been sending tourists seeking ""Mt. Rushmore, SD"" to the wrong location for nearly five years now. Storm Mountain Center, a retreat center located some 13 miles from the real Mt. Rushmore, has repeatedly asked Google Maps to update the Mt. Rushmore address. But whatever fixes proved temporary for unknown reasons -- and as of this writing, the address is still wrong. Eventually, the center has resorted to installing a large sign at the front of their driveway instructing travelers that their electronic devices are wrong about Mt. Rushmore’s location. Despite this, guest services manager Ashley Wilsey told the   that she regularly encounters a near-constant flow of tourists mistakenly navigating to the center. Although Google Maps is fast becoming the ultimate authority on navigation, the program is proving vulnerable to mistakes and hackers with results that at times can be catastrophic. One of the latest blunders involved a company accidentally bulldozing the wrong house due to faulty Google Maps directions. Google took responsibility for the maps error. In this case, two different houses were shown as being in the same location, a Google spokeswoman told  . In 2010, Nicaragua blamed an   of Costa Rica on incorrect Google Maps information. These cases shed light on the software's susceptibility to errors and hacks. Google Maps is   layers of information obtained from satellite images as well as photographs taken by Street View cars, which have driven and photographed more than 7 million miles of roads.  Google also crowdsources location information through  , which allows users to directly update local addresses and details. An unknown number of people are employed by the company to   these maps for inaccuracies. But despite this multi-faceted system, location bugs and mistakes still happen. Trolls and pranksters have   of the crowdsourced feature by changing businesses to offensive names or by doodling on the map interface. One showed the mascot for Google's mobile operating system, Android, urinating on the Apple logo in an area of Pakistan. More explicit hacks have also proved that Google Maps is easily accessible to outsiders. Cyber security consultant Bryan Seely revealed vulnerabilities in Google Maps in 2014 when he hacked into Google Map's business listings and changed the phone number for the San Francisco FBI office and Washington D.C. Secret Service. In a  article, Seely described a world of con artists who exploit the feature's vulnerabilities with ease by switching business listings and conning unsuspecting callers. He blames Google's less-than-stellar verification system. ""Who is gonna think twice about what Google publishes on their maps? Everyone trusts Google implicitly and it's completely unwarranted and it's completely unsafe,"" Seely   in an interview last year. He also mentioned that he has been paid by companies like Microsoft to spam Google Maps in the past. Then there's the human error element, such as the   of American tourist, Noel Santillan, who drove six hours in the wrong direction in Iceland through wintery conditions due to a small spelling error he entered into Google Maps. For those misguided Mt. Rushmore tourists, even a large metal sign instructing them to turn around couldn't deter them from total GPS obedience. Some researchers have suggested that   is becoming more and more common, and are worried about unforeseen effects. Are we collectively losing our learned sense of direction? Neuroscience studies suggest that yes, Google Maps and GPS systems may indeed be negatively impacting our brains.   at McGill University compared the brains of GPS versus non-GPS users and found that non-GPS users had more grey matter and higher functionality in their hippocampuses than those that relied on their devices. The hippocampus is responsible for memory and spatial navigation, the latter of which uses visual cues to create a cognitive map that assists with directionality. An earlier study showed that London taxi drivers, well-versed in the complex map of the city, had much larger hippocampuses than non-taxi drivers. There is also some correlation between those with a more developed hippocampus and lower chances of Alzheimers. Veronique Bohbot, a neuroscientist who worked on McGill's GPS study, suggests that we limit our GPS use to new destinations only and attempt to build up our cognitive maps by navigating to frequently visited destinations on our own, she said in an article on  . Given recent errors, our memories might wind up being more accurate than Google Maps itself.",March 31,,google

Four of Google’s self-driving vehicles are being driven around Phoenix this week, mapping portions of the metro area ahead of letting the cars loose. Google officials say they will begin having the cars drive in Chandler.  “I’m honored that Google selected Chandler as the first city in Arizona to continue testing its self-driving cars project,” said Chandler Mayor Jay Tibshraeny in a statement. “Google is a perfect fit; adding to our growing list of technology companies doing business in Chandler. This decision by Google cements our reputation as the premiere innovation and technology hub of the Southwest.” Google officials say they hope to see how the cars work in high temperatures and in the massive dust storms that occasionally occur in the summer.  “Also, in some communities, there are golf cart crossings, I understand,” said Jennifer Haroon, head of business operations for the Google Self-Driving Car project. Tibshraeny said the city first talked to Google a little over two weeks ago, and within 10 days they were notified that the cars were coming to town. So far Google has 54 vehicles driving themselves, with Google workers as passengers, in Mountain View, California, — where Google is based — Austin, Texas, and Kirkland, Washington. The self-driving cars are easy to spot by their extra equipment on the roof and their extra courteous manner of driving. Haroon said Arizona has provided a good environment for self-driving vehicle research. On March 9, Gov. Doug Ducey announced the creation of a Self-Driving Oversight Committee to advise the Department of Transportation, the Department of Public Safety, universities and other public agencies on how to advance self-driving vehicles on public roads.

Washington Post,Jeff Amy | AP,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/appeals-court-rules-mississippi-can-resume-google-inquiry/2016/04/09/ae75b6b8-fe86-11e5-813a-90ab563f0dde_story.html,Appeals court rules Mississippi can resume Google inquiry,"JACKSON, Miss. — Mississippi’s attorney general can resume an investigation into whether Google facilitates illegal behavior, an appeals court ruled. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday overturned a district judge who had sided with Google. U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate ruled last year that the unit of Alphabet Inc. didn’t have to answer a subpoena by Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood. Hood began complaining in 2012 that Google wasn’t doing enough to prevent people from breaking the law. In October 2014, he sent a 79-page subpoena demanding Google produce information about a wide range of subjects, including whether Google helps criminals by allowing its search engine to lead to pirated music, having its autocomplete function suggest illegal activities and sharing YouTube ad revenue with the makers of videos promoting illegal drug sales. Instead of complying, Google sued. The appeals court also dissolved the lower judge’s injunction that had barred Hood from bringing any civil or criminal lawsuits against the Mountain View, California-based company, saying that a mere subpoena wasn’t enough to rule that Hood was acting in bad faith.  “This injunction covers a fuzzily defined range of enforcement actions that do not appear imminent,” Chief Circuit Judge Carl E. Stewart wrote for a three-judge panel. “We cannot on the present record predict what conduct Hood might one day try to prosecute under Mississippi law.” The judges also noted that Hood would have to go to state court to force Google to comply with the administrative subpoena and that Google could challenge Hood’s requests then. It wasn’t a complete win for the Democratic attorney general, though. The appeals panel rejected a call by Hood to toss out the entire federal lawsuit by Google, which claims it can’t be sued under the federal Communications Decency Act for what others post on the Internet. Google also claims Hood’s investigation is tainted by a close association with the movie industry. Wingate had ruled Hood’s subpoena was retaliation for Google not knuckling under his demands. The judges said they weren’t ruling whether Hood’s subpoena is reasonable, whether Hood’s actions are sufficient to allow Google to sue, or whether Google was immune federal law. Hood spokeswoman Rachael Ring declined comment Saturday, saying Hood plans to discuss the ruling at a Monday news conference. A number of other attorneys general had asked the appeals court to dissolve the injunction, saying it was a blow to the investigative power of all states. It’s unclear whether Google will appeal.  “We’re reviewing the implications of the court’s decision, which focused on whether our claim was premature rather than on the merits of the case,” spokesman William Fitzgerald wrote in an email Saturday. Google has argued Hood wants to censor the Internet and violate Google’s constitutional rights. Leaked documents indicated that the Motion Picture Association of America helped draft the subpoena. The movie industry and Google have been at odds over copyright law, with studios failing to win more restrictive federal laws. Hood has defended his cooperation with the movie industry, saying he’s working with victims of crimes. ___ Online: U.S. 5th Circuit ruling: http://1.usa.gov/20qx02e ___ Follow Jeff Amy at: http://twitter.com/jeffamy.

Washington Post,Brian Fung,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/04/11/google-fibers-dropping-its-free-internet-plan-in-kansas-city-for-this/,Google Fiber’s dropping its free Internet plan in Kansas City for this,"Maybe you've heard: Google Fiber will soon be dropping support in Kansas City for its lowest-level Internet plan. That subscription tier allowed customers to access the Web for a fantastic $0 per month, after they'd paid a $300 installation fee (which itself could be broken into monthly installments). In exchange, subscribers received a 5 Mbps connection — fast enough for a single Netflix stream and basic Web browsing, perhaps, but not a whole lot more. That plan has already vanished from Google Fiber's website for Kansas City. Right now, the company is advertising instead a $50-per-month plan that gives you speeds of 100 Mbps — a connection that's 20 times faster than the free plan, and much more expensive. But for low-income Kansas City residents, that won't be the only alternative replacing the free Internet plan. As part of Google Fiber's bid to provide more access to the poor, the company will begin offering on May 19 a new product to select needy areas as identified by the Census Bureau, the Federal Communications Commission and data from other sources. Here are the details, as confirmed Monday by Google Fiber: The plan will cost $15 per month and will offer symmetrical speeds of 25 Mbps (that's 25 Mbps on downloads as well as uploads). It'll only be available to eligible areas where a significant percentage of households lack residential Internet access, the company said. Those who live in the designated regions will be automatically able to sign up for the $15 plan and won't have to pay for installation, equipment rentals or other fees. This is on top of existing agreements to provide Google Fiber for free to public housing projects   with the Obama administration. Is this $15-a-month plan a good deal for low-income consumers who aren't covered by that partnership? Well, while the product isn't free, it does meet the FCC's current definition of broadband, which is set at 25 Mbps for downloads and 3 Mbps for uploads. The fact that Google Fiber will be providing a symmetrical connection is a plus — it means users will be better able to create online content, such as videos, art and other media. The price is also pretty competitive. Broadband prices vary by location and provider, of course. But just a quick check of a couple Internet providers' websites suggests that on a cost-per-Mbps basis, the new Google Fiber tier is pretty affordable. Comcast's program for low-income Americans, Internet Essentials, provides speeds of 10 Mbps for $10 a month, working out to about $1 per Mbps. To other consumers, Comcast also advertises a 25 Mbps connection for $40 a month (so about $1.60 per Mbps). Verizon, meanwhile, sells a 50 Mbps connection for $50 a month, so roughly also $1 per Mbps. By comparison, the price of Google's speed tier for low-income Americans works out to roughly 60 cents per Mbps.",April 11,,google
